# OPC PLC server
Implements an OPC UA server with different nodes which generate random data and anomalies.

## Features
The following nodes are part of the PLC simulation:
- with alternating boolean
- random signed 32-bit integer
- random unsigend 32-bit integer
- a sine wave with a spike anomaly
- a sine wave with a dip anomaly
- a value showing a positive trend
- a value showing a negative trend

By default everything is enabled, please use command line options to disable certain anomaly or data generation features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The implementation is based on .NET Core so it is cross-platform and recommended hosting environment is docker.

### Installation

There is no installation required.

### Quickstart

A docker container of the component is hosted in the Microsoft Container Registry and can be pulled by:

docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/iotedge/opc-plc

The tags of the container match the tags of this repository and the containers are available for Windows amd64, Linux amd64 and Linux ARM32.


## Demo

The [OpcClient](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-edge-opc-client) is an OPC UA client, which can be used to work with this OPC UA server implementation.

Please check out the github repository https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-edge-industrial-configs for sample configurations showing usage of this OPC UA server implementation.


## Notes

X.509 certificates releated:

* Running on Windows natively, you can not use an application certificate store of type `Directory`, since the access to the private key fails. Please use the option `--at X509Store` in this case.
* Running as Linux docker container, you can map the certificate stores to the host file system by using the docker run option `-v <hostdirectory>:/appdata`. This will make the certificate persistent over starts.
* Running as Linux docker container and want to use an X509Store for the application certificate, you need to use the docker run option `-v x509certstores:/root/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores` and the application option `--at X509Store`
